## Lessons Learned
This project taught me a lot, like how to interpret UML designs, use classes to extend or implement others, work with arrays, and a new way to use a scanner. But the biggest lesson I learned was to double-check spaces when using a BufferedReader file! I spent hours trying to find a problem that ended up being just an extra space, i.e. ", " should of been ",". I say that with sarcasm but it is the one thing that really stuck out. Another major take away is that I tend to be inefficent with my time. If I took some time to plan out my classes, methods, and write down what I need the program to do as if I were telling a story, I could have saved a lot of time in the long run. But I have to keep reminding meself that these types of experiences are common in software development and help us become better programmers in the end.
